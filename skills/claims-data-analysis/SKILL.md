## Common Analyses

### Patient Cohort Building

```sql
-- Diabetes cohort: 2+ diagnoses or 1 Rx
WITH diabetes_dx AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT member_id
    FROM CLAIMS.MEDICAL
    WHERE dx1 LIKE 'E11%' OR dx2 LIKE 'E11%' OR dx3 LIKE 'E11%'
    GROUP BY member_id
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT claim_id) >= 2
),
diabetes_rx AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT member_id
    FROM CLAIMS.PHARMACY
    WHERE gpi LIKE '27%'  -- Antidiabetics
),
diabetes_cohort AS (
    SELECT member_id FROM diabetes_dx
    UNION
    SELECT member_id FROM diabetes_rx
)
SELECT 
    dc.member_id,
    e.gender,
    DATEDIFF('year', e.birth_date, CURRENT_DATE) AS age,
    e.state
FROM diabetes_cohort dc
JOIN CLAIMS.ELIGIBILITY e ON dc.member_id = e.member_id
WHERE e.term_date >= CURRENT_DATE;
```

### Healthcare Utilization Metrics

```sql
-- PMPM (Per Member Per Month) cost
WITH member_months AS (
    SELECT 
        member_id,
        DATEDIFF('month', eff_date, LEAST(term_date, CURRENT_DATE)) + 1 AS months_enrolled
    FROM CLAIMS.ELIGIBILITY
    WHERE eff_date <= CURRENT_DATE
),
member_costs AS (
    SELECT 
        member_id,
        SUM(paid_amount) AS total_medical
    FROM CLAIMS.MEDICAL
    WHERE service_from_date >= '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY member_id
)
SELECT 
    AVG(mc.total_medical / mm.months_enrolled) AS medical_pmpm,
    SUM(mc.total_medical) / SUM(mm.months_enrolled) AS aggregate_pmpm
FROM member_costs mc
JOIN member_months mm ON mc.member_id = mm.member_id;
```

### Treatment Patterns

```sql
-- First-line therapy analysis
WITH first_rx AS (
    SELECT 
        member_id,
        drug_name,
        fill_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY member_id ORDER BY fill_date) AS rx_order
    FROM CLAIMS.PHARMACY
    WHERE gpi LIKE '27%'  -- Antidiabetics
)
SELECT 
    drug_name,
    COUNT(*) AS patient_count,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 1) AS pct
FROM first_rx
WHERE rx_order = 1
GROUP BY drug_name
ORDER BY patient_count DESC;
```

### Medication Adherence (PDC)

```sql
-- Proportion of Days Covered
WITH rx_fills AS (
    SELECT 
        member_id,
        fill_date,
        days_supply,
        LEAD(fill_date) OVER (PARTITION BY member_id ORDER BY fill_date) AS next_fill
    FROM CLAIMS.PHARMACY
    WHERE gpi LIKE '2720%'  -- Metformin
      AND fill_date >= '2024-01-01'
),
covered_days AS (
    SELECT 
        member_id,
        SUM(LEAST(
            days_supply,
            COALESCE(DATEDIFF('day', fill_date, next_fill), days_supply)
        )) AS days_covered,
        DATEDIFF('day', MIN(fill_date), MAX(fill_date)) + 
            MAX(days_supply) AS observation_period
    FROM rx_fills
    GROUP BY member_id
)
SELECT 
    member_id,
    days_covered,
    observation_period,
    ROUND(days_covered * 100.0 / observation_period, 1) AS pdc,
    CASE WHEN days_covered * 100.0 / observation_period >= 80 THEN 'Adherent' 
         ELSE 'Non-Adherent' END AS adherence_status
FROM covered_days
WHERE observation_period >= 90;
```

### Episode of Care

```sql
-- Group claims into episodes (30-day gap = new episode)
WITH claims_sorted AS (
    SELECT 
        member_id,
        service_from_date,
        paid_amount,
        LAG(service_from_date) OVER (PARTITION BY member_id ORDER BY service_from_date) AS prev_date
    FROM CLAIMS.MEDICAL
    WHERE dx1 LIKE 'M54%'  -- Back pain
),
episode_flags AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        CASE WHEN DATEDIFF('day', prev_date, service_from_date) > 30 
             OR prev_date IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS new_episode
    FROM claims_sorted
),
episodes AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        SUM(new_episode) OVER (PARTITION BY member_id ORDER BY service_from_date) AS episode_num
    FROM episode_flags
)
SELECT 
    member_id,
    episode_num,
    MIN(service_from_date) AS episode_start,
    MAX(service_from_date) AS episode_end,
    COUNT(*) AS claim_count,
    SUM(paid_amount) AS episode_cost
FROM episodes
GROUP BY member_id, episode_num;
```

## Place of Service Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 11 | Office |
| 21 | Inpatient Hospital |
| 22 | Outpatient Hospital |
| 23 | Emergency Room |
| 31 | Skilled Nursing Facility |
| 81 | Independent Lab |

## GPI Drug Classification

| GPI Prefix | Therapeutic Class |
|------------|-------------------|
| 27 | Antidiabetics |
| 39 | Cardiovascular |
| 40 | Antihypertensives |
| 44 | Antihyperlipidemics |
| 57 | Psychotherapeutics |
| 66 | Analgesics |

## HEDIS-Style Measures

```sql
-- Diabetes A1c Testing Rate
WITH diabetic_members AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT member_id
    FROM CLAIMS.MEDICAL
    WHERE dx1 LIKE 'E11%' OR dx2 LIKE 'E11%'
),
a1c_tests AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT member_id
    FROM CLAIMS.MEDICAL
    WHERE proc_code IN ('83036', '83037')  -- A1c CPT codes
      AND service_from_date >= DATEADD('year', -1, CURRENT_DATE)
)
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT a.member_id) AS tested,
    COUNT(DISTINCT d.member_id) AS diabetic,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT a.member_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT d.member_id), 1) AS testing_rate
FROM diabetic_members d
LEFT JOIN a1c_tests a ON d.member_id = a.member_id;
```

## Best Practices

1. **Continuous enrollment**: Require minimum enrollment period for studies
2. **Washout periods**: Look back for prior conditions/treatments
3. **Claims lag**: Allow 60-90 days for claims runout
4. **Validate cohorts**: Cross-check Dx and Rx definitions
5. **Adjust for confounders**: Age, gender, comorbidities
